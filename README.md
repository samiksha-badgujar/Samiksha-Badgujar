Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm a computer science student currently pursuing my undergraduate degree. I have experience with programming languages like Python and Java. I'm always looking to expand my skill set. My main interests are in artificial intelligence and machine learning, but I'm also excited about exploring new areas of computer science.

I'm a lifelong learner and I'm passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest developments in my field. I believe that collaboration is key to success, and I'm always looking for opportunities to work on projects with other developers.
